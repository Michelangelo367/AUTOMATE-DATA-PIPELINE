# Automate-Images + Videos-download

# Introduction :   
Data collection is one of the important steps in Data analysisÂ , Machine learning and Deep learning.
It is the process of gathering information of our interest, in our case it's the images of any type we want to gather.
Without data, we can't model our problem and do analysis of it.  

# Objective :
ğŸ‘‰ Automate the downloading of images using Google Custom search API.   
ğŸ‘‰ OptionalÂ : Resizing the images, Zipping the images and Sending a mail to yourself.    

# Getting credentials from Google Custom Search API :   

> Get the detailed steps and some troubleshooting help [here](https://github.com/souravs17031999/AUTOMATE-DATA-PIPELINE/blob/master/google_api.txt).

* First, Create a [Gmail account](http://gmail.com/) for developement (or testing).
* Next , head on to [google developers console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and follow the steps below to create the new project (if you don't have any), you can skip this step if you already have some running project.

* Enable the API from [API explorer](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/) and Get the credentials as API KEY for accesing the API.

# Getting Started Locally : 

* After getting the credentials , we can now run the script for automation.  
* Firstly download all the files on your system using cmd (terminal) or git bash :     
```git clone https://github.com/souravs17031999/AUTOMATE-DATA-PIPELINE```   

## With Tkinter GUI : 
* Move to the directory where script is downloaded.    
* Now run the script in following way :  
```python data_automation.py```          
and arguments can be passed from interactive GUI.
