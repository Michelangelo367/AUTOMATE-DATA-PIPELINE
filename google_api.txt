# STEPS FOR CREATING CREDENTIALS FOR GOOGLE CUSTOM SEARCH API 
------------------------------------------
* Create google account for developement 
* Create a new project first from developers console if there is no existing project
* Visit https://cse.google.com/cse/all to create custom search engine using one of your already existing websites (portfolio or blog or any other)
* Now set "image search" option to "ON"
* set the option to "search the entire web" to "ON"
* copy the "search engine ID" and keep it safe 
*  go to "API explorer" by opening "developer console"
* Click on "enable API's and service" and choose "GOOGLE CUSTOM SEARCH API" and enable it if not already enabled 
* Then , click on credentials on left side of console and then create new credentials which gives "API keys"
* copy it and keep it safe.

---------------------------------------------

* Now, we are ready to fire our API using requests (GET OR POST)
* API parameters required are explained below :
fire requests to below link to make request to API : 

- > "https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?[parameters]"

Now, parameters are described by using "&" infront of them like
GET https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY&cx=017576662512468239146:omuauf_lfve&q=lectures

Here, key is API key, cx is search engine id, and query is string for which to search for

* If API limit reached error shows, then simply create new project and with new Credentials (API keys) , keeping custom search 
engine id same .
Generally the limit is 100 requests per day.
