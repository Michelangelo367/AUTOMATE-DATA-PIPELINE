# STEPS FOR CREATING CREDENTIALS FOR YouTube Data API v3
-------------------------------------
* Create a google account for developement 
* Create a new project first from developers console if there is no existing project
* Go to API explorer from developers console
* enabe "YouTube Data API v3"
* Authenticate first from "OAuth consent screen" configuration from left side of console 
* Then come to "credentials" , create credentials by selecting "OAuth client ID " , then download the client secrets file and copy the 
API key and keep it safe
-----------------------------------------

* Now, we can fire the API
* Here we are using Google-Oauthlib-flow library for making authorization flow easier 
* keep the clients secrets file in the same directory of the project and copy the exact path and use it in the function provided 
in the project named "main" as parameters and everything else including authorization is automated through web.
Only at the last step , we need to ctrl + v so that we can simply paste the already copied token from clipboard and then press 
enter , authorization will be completed.
* For controlling other parameters : 
we have to modify the "main" funciton itself.
